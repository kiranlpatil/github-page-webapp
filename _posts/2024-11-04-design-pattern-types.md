# Design Patterns Overview

In software development, **design patterns** are reusable solutions to common design problems. They provide a standard approach to solving issues related to code structure, object creation, and object interaction, making code more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. Design patterns are generally grouped into three main types:

---

## Types of Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns
**Purpose**: Focus on ways to create objects, reducing the complexity of object instantiation.

Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process, allowing for greater flexibility and reuse of code. They provide various ways to create objects, ensuring that system components are decoupled from how objects are created.

**Examples**: Singleton, Factory, Builder

---

### 2. Structural Patterns
**Purpose**: Define relationships between objects, making it easier to compose and scale complex structures.

Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They ensure that the system’s parts work together seamlessly and promote code that is easier to manage and extend.

**Examples**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade

---

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
**Purpose**: Manage object interactions and communication, improving flexibility and responsibility delegation.

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, outlining how objects interact and distribute responsibilities. This reduces tight coupling between classes and promotes flexible and scalable code.

**Examples**: Observer, Strategy, Command

## Summary

Design patterns are essential in software engineering for building efficient, modular, and reusable code. By following design patterns, developers can tackle recurring design challenges more effectively, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable software. Each pattern type serves a unique purpose, addressing different aspects of code design, from object creation to structural organization to interaction management.
